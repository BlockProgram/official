  My relationship to technology and why I'm learning programming
</h3>

<div class="first-sentence-techoriented">
  <p>
    Technology = the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes (machinery, equipment...)
  </p>
</div>

 <p>
   All the things we take for granted nowadays like smartphones, Wifi or airplanes were once a fantasy.
   That's why we are very fortunate to live during the 21th century;
    even though we'll achieve much more in the coming centuries.  I can't wait for 2057!

<p>
  The older I get, the more attracted I am to technology in general and the more
  eager I am to learn & to participate in the advancement of our tools.
  It is particularly important to become familiar with high-tech in a world that increasingly uses it.
</p>

<p>
  IoT, robotics, AI and maybe one day Artificial General Intelligence!
  Technology is accelerating and the ones who embrace it the most will do well in the coming decades.
</p>
<p>
  As Malcolm X said "the future belongs to those who prepare for it today".

<h3>
  My motivation to learn programming
</h3>

<p>
  For a very long time, I believed that computers and programming were too complex for me
  and that I should stick to being an end-user.
  Fortunately, my curiosity and ambition led me to discover the truth: if you want it bad, you can achieve anything.
</p>

<p>
  Here are the main reasons I started learning programming:
</p>

<div class="list-post-achievingmore">
  <li>
    1) To be in tune with our technological world
  </li>
  <p>
    Tech' is everywhere and its expansion throughout the world is accelerating.
  </p>
  <p>
    As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil" target="-_blank" rel="noopener">
    Raymond Kurzweil</a>, famous inventor, futurist and Google engineer, details in his novel
    <a href="https://www.danielleworld.com/" target="-_blank" rel="noopener">"Danielle"</a>,
    being able to code is a critical skill to become a modern superhero.
  </p>
  <li>
    2) Being able to create software
  </li>
  <p>
    Using a computer program or an electronic device like a drone is cool but what's cooler is to be capable of
    creating your own software or device based on your needs and ideas.
  </p>
  <li>
    3) A nomadic lifestyle
  </li>
  <p>
    It's to me a very important aspect about the job of web developer and similar positions;
    you can travel the world and work remotely with ease.
