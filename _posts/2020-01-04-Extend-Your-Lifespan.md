    In this article, I'm going over the best strategies I learned from top entrepreneurs, books & my own experience.
  </h3>

  <p>
    Productivity is rightfully a major topic covering all aspects of our lives. Because time is limited, we must maximize its utility.
  </p>

   <p>
     The most interesting lessons I've came across in my whole life are from
     <a href="https://medium.com/@sergefaguet" target="-_blank" rel="noopener">Serge Faguet</a>.
     A serial entrepreneur and biohacker who wrote several priceless articles on Medium the past few years.
     <br>
     My favorite one is entitled
     <a
      href="https://medium.com/hackernoon/biohack-your-intelligence-now-or-become-obsolete-97cdd15e395f"
      target="-_blank" rel="noopener">"How to biohack your intelligence"
     </a>.
     This piece describes in rich detail how to become much more "intelligent" & thus effective each day;
     by getting more sleep for example.
   </p>

  <h3>
    Here are to me the most important habits he recommends for optimal performance:
  </h3>

  <div class="list-post-achievingmore">
    <li>
      Iterate over and over
    </li>
    <p>
      Notice what you're not doing perfectly and improve.
    </p>
    <li>
      Fix your sleep (7-8 hours)
    </li>
    <p>
      More sleep = more energy, memory... = more productivity
    </p>
    <li>
      Set goals on many time frames (daily, weekly, yearly, ultimate goals)
    </li>
    <li>
      Cut off any distraction when you work, to get into a state of flow
    </li>
  </div>


  <p>
    There are so many valuable lessons in his articles that I suggest you read it all to achieve greater levels of productivity.

    Other than that, here are a few more tips coming from various sources:
  </h3>

  <li>
    Use a to-do list
  </li>

  <p>
    Something I really like doing. It allows me to plan in advance, to prioritise tasks and to never forget anything.
    My go to solution is <a href="https://www.pivotaltracker.com/dashboard" target="-_blank" rel="noopener">
    Pivotal Tracker</a>
    , an agile project management tool usually used for software development but it works fine for your daily tasks too!
  </p>

  <li>
  Use a pomodoro
  </li>

  <p>
    You may be familiar with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique" target="-_blank" rel="noopener">
    pomodoro technique</a>
    , a way of organizing your work by splitting it into blocks.
    For example, you may concentrate deeply on a task for 25 minutes and then take a break of 5 minutes.
    It's a great way to stay on track, here is the online pomotimer I use:
