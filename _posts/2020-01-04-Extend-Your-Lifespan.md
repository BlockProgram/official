    Various advanced technologies combined with extensive research on our physiology are allowing us to live much longer
  </h3>

  <p>
    Being alive is great isn't it?!
  </p>
  <p>
     Despite all the mystery around our universe, human beings and life in general;
     our ultimate goal should always be to increase our lifespan & healthspan (quality of life).
     This article introduces you to my philosophy regarding longevity as well as to the strategies I apply.

  <img class="post-img" src="/images/life-expectancy.png" alt="life expectancy graph 1770 2018">

   <p>
     After looking at the above graph, we clearly see the progress we made during
     the last decades when it comes to life expectancy. Imagine having 30 years
     to live as a man living in 1800, that would suck!
   </p>

   <p>
     As of today, the average american woman has a life expectancy of 81 years.
     Which is great compared to the past but pale into insignifiance compared to what could be possible
     ideally. Consider that the oldest person that ever lived, Jeanne Calment, died aged 122.
     While this age is remarkable, many scientists argue that human beings could live much longer
     and stay younger in the process.

   <p>
     Below are the most important habits to enhance our lifespan that I know of as well as a
     few online resources to become (at least) a supercentenarian!

     completely changed my daily life thanks to his

    Other than that, here are a few more tips coming from various sources:
  </h3>

  <li>
    Use a to-do list
  </li>

  <p>
    Something I really like doing. It allows me to plan in advance, to prioritise tasks and to never forget anything.
    My go to solution is <a href="https://www.pivotaltracker.com/dashboard" target="-_blank" rel="noopener">
    Pivotal Tracker</a>
    , an agile project management tool usually used for software development but it works fine for your daily tasks too!
  </p>

  <li>
  Use a pomodoro
  </li>

  <p>
    You may be familiar with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique" target="-_blank" rel="noopener">
    pomodoro technique</a>
    , a way of organizing your work by splitting it into blocks.
    For example, you may concentrate deeply on a task for 25 minutes and then take a break of 5 minutes.
    It's a great way to stay on track, here is the online pomotimer I use:
