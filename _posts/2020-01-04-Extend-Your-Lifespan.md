<h3 class="post-summary">
  Various advanced technologies combined with extensive research on our physiology are allowing us to live much longer
</h3>

<p>
  Being alive is great isn't it?!
</p>
<p>
   Despite all the mystery around our universe, human beings and life in general;
   our ultimate goal should always be to increase our lifespan & healthspan (quality of life).
   This article introduces you to my philosophy regarding longevity, strategies to live longer as well as my mentors on this subject.
</p>


<img class="post-img" src="/images/life-expectancy.png" alt="life expectancy graph 1770 2018">

<p>
 After looking at the above graph, we clearly see the progress we made during
 the last decades when it comes to life expectancy. Imagine having 30 years
 to live as a man living in 1800, that would not be fun!
</p>

<p>
 As of today, the average american woman has a life expectancy of 81 years.
 Which is great compared to the past but pale into insignifiance compared to what could be possible
 ideally. Consider that the oldest person that ever lived, Jeanne Calment, died aged 122.
 While this age is remarkable, many scientists argue that human beings could live much longer
 and stay younger in the process.
</p>

<p>
 Below are the most important habits that I know of to enhance our lifespan as well as a
 few online resources to become (at least) a supercentenarian!
</p>

<h3>
 Sleep
</h3>

<p>
  Although we might consider it a waste of time, sleep is actually crucial to one's health.
  It is during that period that your body and mind heal so you should always go for 7 to 8 hours of sleep.
  Sleeping, as you already know, is also critical to our productivity.
</p>
<p>
  You can read <a href="https://www.amazon.fr/Why-We-Sleep-Science-Dreams/dp/0241269067"
  target="-_blank" rel="noopener">"Why We Sleep" </a>
  if you want to discover all the benefits it has according to science.
</p>

<h3>
 Intermittent Fasting
</h3>

<p>
  I've started fasting after reading Serge Faguet's articles who says the following
  on fasting: "Do you actually think you evolved to have an around-the-clock buffet?
  Do you think the hunter-gatherers ate 5 times a day?".
  <br>
  It's highly important to consider the point he's making. Our genes thus our body are those of an Homo Sapiens, a specy that first evolved
  more than 300,000 years ago. We must comply with our internal programming to live a long & healthy life.
</p>
<p>
  In that context, fasting is approriate and has many benefits such as triggering
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autophagy" target="-_blank" rel="noopener">Autophagy</a>
  (cleaning & renewal of our cells), reducing probabilities of various diseases,
   increasing intelligence and also productivity by saving time.
</p>

<h3>
 Exercise
</h3>

<p>
  Like fasting, exercising is a natural behavior for us Homo Sapiens Humans.
</p>
<p>
  Here are the main benefits of it:
  <br>
  - Strenghten the heart
  <br>
  - Keeps muscles and bones in shape
  <br>
  - Boosts our mood (dopamine)
  <br>
  - Good for new neurons creations and memory
  <br>
  - Metabolic effects (hormones, insulin sensitivity)
</p>

<li>Serge Faguet</li>

<p>
 In first place on my "live longer" list comes Serge Faguet's advices.
 He's an entrepreneur & biohacker who completely changed my daily life thanks to his
 <a href="https://medium.com/@sergefaguet" target="-_blank" rel="noopener">Medium articles</a>.
 Optimization at every level is an obsession for him so it's no surprise he adopts the best habits
 to affect longevity.
</p>

<li>Peter Attia</li>

<p>
 Serge Faguet's health is monitored by one of best longevity experts on Earth: Dr Peter Attia.
 He's responsible for many of the great insights Serge has written about so I recommend checking
 out <a href=" https://peterattiamd.com/" target="-_blank" rel="noopener">his website & podcast</a>.
</p>

<li>David Sinclair </li>

<p>
  One of the world's most knowledgeable individuals on the subject of longevity.
  He's a biologist and professor at the Harvard Medical School and has studied aging all his life.
  It's thanks to scientists like him that we have a shot at curing aging.
</p>
<p>
  He recently released a book called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lifespan-Why-Age-Dont-Have-ebook/dp/B07N4C6LGR"
  target="-_blank" rel="noopener">
  Lifespan: Why We Age - and Why We Don't Have To"</a> that I plan on reading soon.
</p>



<li>Aubrey de Grey</li>

<p>
  English author and biomedical gerontologist, he's a major figure in the transhumanism community for
  his belief that we might find ways to keep humans alive indefinitely.
  He's also one of the few that popularized the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longevity_escape_velocity">
  Longevity Escape Velocity</a> which basically describes a situation where life expectancy
  is extended longer than the time that is passing.

<br>

<li>Singularity University</li>
<p>
  To change your perception of the future, Singularity University is THE entity to listen to.
  The company, that got created by visionaries (Diamandis & Kurzweil), offers educational
  programs as well as incubation and consultancy services.
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/singularityu" target="-_blank" rel="noopener">
  Their youtube channel
  </a> is a goldmine where you'll learn how great the future
  is going to be in various sectors such as transportation and in our case health.
