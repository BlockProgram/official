Being productive simply means achieving your goals as fast as possible.
In this article,
 I'm going over the best strategies I learned from top entrepreneurs, books & my own experience.

 The most interesting lessons I've came across in my whole life are from Serge Faguet. A serial entrepreneur and biohacker who wrote several priceless articles on Medium the past few years.

 My favorite one is entitled "How to biohack your intelligence". This piece describes in rich details how to become much more "intelligent" & thus effective each day; by getting more sleep for example.

Here are to me the most important habits he recommends for optimal performance:
1) Iterate over and over. See what you're not doing perfectly and improve
1) Fix your sleep. More sleep = more energy = more productive 7-8 hours is optimal 
2) Set goals on many time frames (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, ultimate goal)
3) Cut off any distraction when you work to get into a state of flow
3) READ AGAIN HIS ARTICLES TO EXTRACT INSIGHTS

There are so many valuable lessons in his articles that I suggest you refer to it to achieve greater levels of productivity.

Other than that, here are a few more tips coming from various sources:
X) Use a to-dolist

Something I really like doing. It allows me to plan in advance, to prioritise tasks and to never forget anything

X) Use a pomodoro

You may be familiar with the pomodoro technique, a way of organizing your work by splitting it into sessions. Say you concentrate deeply on your task for 25 minutes and then take a break of 5 minutes. It's a great way to stay on track, here is the online tool I use when on my laptop:
